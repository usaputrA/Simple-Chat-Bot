The following functions are tools we created to make your A1 programming lives
easier. You should not modify this file.

Note that they use course material that you'll see in the coming weeks.
You can and should call them in your program; they'll do a lot of the
tricky work for you.

Read the docstrings and doctests to see how to use them â€” you only need to
understand the data that comes in and the data that comes out, not how the
code inside the function works.
